# Advent of Code 2019

Just me solving this year's puzzles in C++

To run a specific puzzle, run the program with two parameters  
./advent [number of the day] [input filename]  
Day 4 doesnt need any input file, but the program expects 2 parameters  
so input anything you want as the input filename
